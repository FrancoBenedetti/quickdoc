# QUICKDOC
Quickdoc is a simple application that allows Google Docs to be used to present a collection of these as an online user manual or documentation.

Simply use Google Docs to create the different parts of your user manuals and then expose these to your users using Quickdocs.

Only users that have been granted permission to edit the underlying Google Docs document, will be able to do so from the like available on the ‘edit’ link in the right side bar menu.

For documents to be viewable publicly, the linked Google Docs document must be shared using Publish to the Web.

This set of files should be copied into a folder, e.g. with the name 'manual' or 'documentation'.

Access the sample manual by using, e.g. https://yourdomain.com/manual.
